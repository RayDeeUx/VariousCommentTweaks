# VariousCommentTweaks Changelog
## v1.1.2
- The "Detect language" option from the `Translation Source Language` mod setting will be treated as "translate from Spanish", *just* so DeepL will properly read a comment's text from the URL.
  - DeepL's devs are a bit... "special", so this was my most reasonable solution. Thanks to CherryChip for the reminder!
## v1.1.1
- Fix another batch of crashes. Thanks to AlphaQuata for the report!
## v1.1.0
- New button sprites and gradient designs by [Brift](https://twitter.com/BriftXD)!
